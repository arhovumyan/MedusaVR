## Standard Workflow
1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files. Write a plan to documentation/tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them

3. Before you begin working, print out what you are planning to do, then proceed executing those tasks.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Make sure you rebuild the project after finishing up your task to make sure that your program is running as intended without bugs. 
8. Make sure you rebuild the project after finishing up your task to make sure that your program is running as intended without bugs.
9. If you are building test files, create them in /testing and access them from that folder.
10. You need to make sure that you are putting secuity at first. Leave as less vulnerabilities as possible.
11. All these files that you create should be stored in the /documentation folder.
12. From now on dont use shell scripts to test anything, you are freezing when you do that. just user "docker compose up --build -d " then "docker compose logs " to see the logs if you want to see its progress. DONT USE ANY SHELL SCRIPTS.
13. Use the reflection.md file from root directory to reflect on your work and improve every time.
14. Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
