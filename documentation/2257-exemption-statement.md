**Last updated: August 5, 2025**

## No Actual Visual Depictions of Real Persons Engaged in Sexually Explicit Conduct

MEDUSAVR generates all images, videos, and visual content entirely through artificial intelligence techniques. All characters are fictional and computer-generated; no real human performers are photographed, filmed, or otherwise visually depicted engaging in sexually explicit conduct.

## Exemption under 18 U.S.C. ยง 2257 & 28 C.F.R. 75.7

Because the MEDUSAVR platform does not contain any actual visual depiction of real human beings engaged in actual sexually explicit conduct, MEDUSAVR is exempt from the record-keeping and labeling requirements of 18 U.S.C. ยง 2257 and 28 C.F.R. Part 75.

## Fictional Representations Only

- All images and visual content are computer-generated through AI technology
- All content is created through user text or voice prompts processed by artificial intelligence
- Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental
- No real individuals participate in the creation of any visual content on the platform
