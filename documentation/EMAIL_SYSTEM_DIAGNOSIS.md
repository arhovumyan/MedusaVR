## 🚀 How to Enable Real Email Sending

### Step 1: Get SendGrid API Key
```bash
# 1. Go to https://sendgrid.com/
# 2. Create a free account (100 emails/day)
# 3. Verify your account via email
# 4. Go to Settings > API Keys
# 5. Create API Key > Restricted Access
# 6. Give it "Mail Send" permission only
# 7. Copy the API key
```

### Step 2: Update Configuration
```bash
# Edit server/.env file and replace:
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here

# With your actual API key:
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_actual_api_key_here
```

### Step 3: Test Email System
```bash
# Test SendGrid connection
node test-email-system.js --connection-only

# Send test email to yourself
node test-email-system.js --test-email your@email.com

# Test complete signup flow
node test-email-system.js --signup-flow
```

## 🧪 Testing Commands Available
