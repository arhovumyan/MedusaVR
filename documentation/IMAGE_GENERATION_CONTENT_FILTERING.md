# Image Generation Content Filtering Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive content filtering system implemented for image generation to prevent the creation of inappropriate images involving minors or animals. The system includes prompt filtering, automatic banning, enhanced negative prompts, and proper frontend error handling.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Safety Features

### 1. Zero Tolerance Policy
- **Minors**: Any attempt to generate images of people under 18 years old results in immediate action
- **Animals**: Attempts to generate inappropriate animal content are strictly prohibited
- **Automatic Enforcement**: The system automatically detects and blocks these attempts with immediate consequences

### 2. Automatic Banning System
- **Minor Content**: First offense results in **immediate permanent ban**
- **Animal Content**: Progressive enforcement (warning ‚Üí temporary ban ‚Üí permanent ban)
- **Violation Tracking**: All attempts are logged with full evidence retention

## Implementation Details

### Backend Components

#### 1. ImageModerationService (`server/services/ImageModerationService.ts`)

**Purpose**: Core content filtering engine for image generation prompts

**Key Features**:
- **Minor Content Detection**: 50+ patterns detecting age references, school contexts, physical descriptors
- **Animal Content Detection**: 40+ patterns detecting inappropriate animal content, furry content, bestiality
- **Pattern Matching**: Advanced regex patterns with variations, l33t speak, and evasion attempts
- **Enhanced Negative Prompts**: Automatic injection of safety terms to prevent unwanted content

**Detection Patterns Include**:

*Minor Content*:
- Direct age references (`17 years old`, `sixteen`, `teen`, `underage`)
- School contexts (`high school`, `student`, `schoolgirl`)
- Physical descriptors (`baby face`, `childlike`, `flat chest`)
- Evasion attempts (`barely legal but looks 17`)
- L33t speak (`t33n`, `und3rag3`)

*Animal Content*:
- Animal references (`dog`, `cat`, `horse`, `furry`)
- Anthropomorphic content (`cat girl`, `furry`, `anthro`)
- Inappropriate contexts (`bestiality`, `animal sex`)
- Mythical creatures (`centaur in erotic pose`)

#### 2. Route Integration

**Modified Routes**:
- `/api/image-generation/generate` - Main image generation endpoint
- `/api/image-generation/generate-immediate` - Immediate generation endpoint  
- `/api/characters/:id/generate-image` - Character-specific image generation

**Middleware Integration**:
```typescript
router.post('/generate', 
  ImageModerationService.moderateImageGeneration, 
  imageController.generateImage
);
```

#### 3. Enhanced Negative Prompts

**RunPodService Integration**:
- Automatic enhancement of negative prompts with safety terms
- Comprehensive list of prohibited terms automatically added
- Existing negative prompts are preserved and enhanced

**Safety Terms Include**:
```
child, children, minor, teen, underage, animal, furry, 
bestiality, loli, shota, schoolgirl, etc.
```

#### 4. Violation Tracking & Banning

**UserBanService Integration**:
- Automatic violation recording in database
- IP address tracking and potential blacklisting
- Evidence retention with full audit trail
- Integration with existing user management system

**Ban Logic**:
- Minor content: Immediate permanent ban (first offense)
- Animal content: Progressive enforcement based on violation history
- All bans include detailed evidence and cannot be appealed for age violations

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Enhanced Error Handling

**CharacterImageGenerator Component**:
- Specific handling for content moderation violations
- Clear error messages explaining policy violations
- Account ban notifications with appeal information

**Error Response Handling**:
```typescript
if (errorData.code === 'IMAGE_CONTENT_VIOLATION') {
  toast({
    title: "Content Policy Violation",
    description: errorData.message,
    variant: "destructive"
  });
}
```

#### 2. User Experience

**Clear Feedback**:
- Immediate notification when content is blocked
- Specific guidance on what was detected
- No ambiguous error messages

**Ban Notifications**:
- Clear explanation of ban reason
- Information about ban duration (temporary vs permanent)
- Contact information for appeals (where applicable)

## Testing

### Automated Test Suite

**Test Coverage**: 15 test cases covering:
- Clean prompts (should pass)
- Minor content detection
- Animal content detection
- Edge cases and evasion attempts

**Test Results**: ‚úÖ 15/15 tests passing

**Test File**: `server/scripts/test-image-moderation.ts`

### Manual Testing

**Recommended Tests**:
1. Try generating images with obvious violations
2. Test subtle evasion attempts
3. Verify ban system activates correctly
4. Confirm frontend shows appropriate errors

## Security Considerations

### 1. Evasion Prevention
- Multiple pattern variations for common evasion attempts
- L33t speak detection
- Context-aware detection (not just keyword matching)
- Regular expression patterns that catch subtle references

### 2. Evidence Retention
- Full prompt content hashed and stored
- IP address and user agent logging
- Session and device fingerprinting
- Timestamp and endpoint tracking

### 3. Compliance Features
- Automatic violation reporting for severe cases
- Export functionality for law enforcement
- Evidence chain preservation
- Administrative review capabilities

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables required - the system integrates with existing infrastructure.

### Customization
- Pattern lists can be updated in `ImageModerationService.ts`
- Ban durations configurable in `ContentModerationService.ts`
- Negative prompt terms customizable in safety generation

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Logging
- All violations logged with severity: CRITICAL
- Security incidents automatically flagged
- Pattern matching results recorded
- User behavior tracking for repeat offenders

### Alerts
```
üö® IMAGE GENERATION SECURITY INCIDENT
üö®üö® CRITICAL IMAGE SAFETY ALERT üö®üö®
```

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
1. **Pattern Review**: Monthly review of detection patterns
2. **False Positive Analysis**: Monitor for legitimate content being blocked
3. **Evasion Monitoring**: Watch for new bypass techniques
4. **Performance Impact**: Ensure filtering doesn't slow image generation

### Analytics
- Track violation attempt frequency
- Monitor ban effectiveness
- Analyze pattern match accuracy
- Review user appeal patterns

## Legal Compliance

### Age Verification
- Strict enforcement of 18+ only content
- Multiple detection layers for age references
- Immediate action on any suspected minor content

### Evidence Handling
- Secure storage of violation evidence
- Law enforcement cooperation capabilities
- Privacy-compliant data retention
- Audit trail maintenance

## Integration Notes

### Existing Systems
- Seamlessly integrates with current chat moderation
- Uses existing user ban infrastructure  
- Leverages current violation tracking database
- Maintains consistent enforcement across platforms

### Performance
- Lightweight pattern matching
- No significant impact on generation speed
- Efficient regex compilation
- Minimal memory overhead

## Conclusion

This implementation provides comprehensive protection against inappropriate image generation while maintaining a good user experience for legitimate use cases. The system is designed to be robust against evasion attempts while providing clear feedback to users about policy violations.

The zero-tolerance approach for minor content and strict enforcement for animal content ensures compliance with legal requirements and platform safety standards.
