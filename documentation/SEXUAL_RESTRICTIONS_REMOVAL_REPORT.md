- ✅ Removed prostitution from restricted list
- ✅ Added back "forced sex" and "family sex" to maintain safety

### 4. Content Safety Service (`server/services/ContentSafetyService.ts`)

- ❌ All violent content (murder, torture, etc.)

## VERIFICATION:

## IMPACT:
Users can now engage in normal adult conversations and content creation without being blocked for consensual sexual terms, while all critical safety protections remain in place to prevent harmful, illegal, or exploitative content.
