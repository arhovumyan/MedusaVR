# Substring Filtering Implementation Summary

## Problem
Users were bypassing the prohibited words filter by adding extra letters to restricted words:
- "dog" → "dogPod" (previously allowed)
- "animal" → "animalsssss" (previously allowed) 
- "child" → "childish" (previously allowed)
- "minor" → "minorly" (previously allowed)

## Solution
Updated both filtering systems to use **substring matching** instead of **word boundary matching**.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `client/src/lib/prohibitedWordsFilter.ts`
**Before:**
```typescript
private containsWord(text: string, word: string): boolean {
  // Used word boundaries (\b) which could be bypassed
  const regex = new RegExp(`\\b${this.escapeRegExp(word)}\\b`, 'i');
  return regex.test(text);
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
private containsWord(text: string, word: string): boolean {
  // Simple substring matching - prevents all bypass attempts
  return text.toLowerCase().includes(word.toLowerCase());
}
```

### 2. Updated `shared/content-filter.ts`
**Before:**
```typescript
for (const word of RESTRICTED_WORDS) {
  if (lowercaseText.includes(word.toLowerCase())) {
    // Additional word boundary check
    const wordBoundary = new RegExp(`\\b${word.toLowerCase()}\\b`, 'i');
    if (wordBoundary.test(lowercaseText)) {
      blockedWords.push(word);
    }
  }
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
for (const word of RESTRICTED_WORDS) {
  if (lowercaseText.includes(word.toLowerCase())) {
    // Direct substring matching - no bypass possible
    blockedWords.push(word);
  }
}
```

### 3. Updated `filterContentLenient()` function
Applied the same substring matching logic to the lenient filter used during typing.

## Test Results
✅ **"dog"** → BLOCKED  
✅ **"dogPod"** → BLOCKED (now catches bypass attempt)  
✅ **"animalsssss"** → BLOCKED (now catches bypass attempt)  
✅ **"childish"** → BLOCKED (now catches bypass attempt)  
✅ **"minorly"** → BLOCKED (now catches bypass attempt)  
✅ **"hello world"** → ALLOWED (legitimate content still works)  

## Impact
- **Security Enhanced**: No more bypass attempts using extra letters
- **Comprehensive Protection**: All prohibited words are now strictly enforced
- **Consistent Behavior**: Both filtering systems (`prohibitedWordsFilter.ts` and `content-filter.ts`) now use the same logic
- **Application-Wide**: Changes apply to:
  - Chat input filtering
  - Image generation prompt filtering  
  - Character creation filtering
  - All other content validation points

## Deployment Status
✅ Changes implemented across all filtering systems  
✅ Build verification completed  
✅ No external dependencies required  
✅ Ready for production use
