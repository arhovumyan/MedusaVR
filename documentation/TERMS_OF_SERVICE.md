Last modified: August 5, 2025

Welcome to MedusaVR!

These Terms of Use (“TOU”) outline the rules and regulations for the use of our website available at: https://www.medusavr.com/ (the “Website”), the MedusaVR mobile application available through Apple’s App Store or the Google Play Marketplace (the “App(s)”) and the services available through the Website and App(s) (the “Services”).

Before accessing or using the Website, the App(s) or Services you (“You”) will have to carefully review and agree to these TOU. Please note that It is essential to review the TOU carefully to understand your rights, responsibilities, and limitations while using the Website, App(s), and Services. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the TOU, please reach out to us for clarification.

Please note that the Website, App(s) and Services are designed only for individuals over the age of 18. If you are under 18 years old, you must not use or attempt to access the Website, App(s), or Services in any manner.

**1. ABOUT MedusaVR**
The Website is owned and offered by RInterior (based in Delaware, USA), and its fully owned subsidiaries and agents (MedusaVR or “We”, “Us”, “Our”).

MedusaVR provides users with an immersive platform to create, customize, and interact with AI-powered virtual characters within a virtual reality (VR) environment. Our services leverage generative artificial intelligence (AI) to allow users to design unique characters and engage in dynamic conversations and experiences with them, as well as with characters developed by other users.

MedusaVR can generate images and assets based on text descriptions to be used for character creation and in-world experiences. While we strive to ensure that the content generated by MedusaVR is safe and appropriate, we cannot guarantee that it will be. We are not responsible for any harm that may result from the use of MedusaVR's content generation features. We encourage users to use these features responsibly.

In order to use the Services, a user shall register a MedusaVR user account using either a social login (e.g., Discord, Google) or an email address and password.

The core Services are provided to users at no charge, offering basic functionalities. Additional coins or credits are available for purchase, enabling access to the full spectrum of features. MedusaVR offers in-app purchases designed to enhance and enrich the user experience.

For example, new users upon signing up receive a complimentary balance of 100 coins, which can be used to generate their first character and initiate a number of interactions. After this balance is used, users can earn additional credits by completing specified tasks. Users with paid subscriptions have greater privileges, including the ability to generate multiple advanced characters and access monthly coin packages ranging from 10,000 to 50,000, depending on the subscription tier. These credits reset monthly and cannot be carried over to the next subscription period.

**25. COMPLAINTS POLICY**
At MEDUSAVR, we prioritize a safe and compliant environment for all users. We strongly encourage users to report any content they believe might be illegal or violates these TOU. Upon receiving a complaint, MEDUSAVR commits to conducting a thorough review of the reported content within 7 (seven) business days.

**26. CANCELLATION POLICY FOR RECURRING TRANSACTIONS**
Users subscribed to recurring transactions (subscriptions, memberships, etc.) with MEDUSAVR have the right to cancel their subscription from rebilling at any time.

If you wish to cancel your subscription and prevent further rebilling, you can do so under the manage subscription page of your account. Upon receipt of your cancellation request, we will promptly process the cancellation. Please note that cancellation requests made prior to the next billing cycle will cease future charges. However, cancellation requests received after the commencement of the new billing period may result in charges for that billing cycle, with the cancellation taking effect in the subsequent billing cycle. Upon successful cancellation, you will receive a confirmation notification via email to acknowledge the termination of the recurring transaction.

Please note that cancellation of the recurring transaction does not entitle you to a refund for any charges already incurred unless otherwise specified in these TOU. For any inquiries or assistance regarding the cancellation of recurring transactions, please reach out to us at support@medusavr.com.

This Cancellation Policy ("Policy") also outlines the procedures for cancelling your MEDUSAVR subscription through our payment providers. To cancel your subscription, please follow the instructions provided by the third-party payment processor used for the transaction (e.g., on their website or through their customer support). Your subscription will be canceled at the end of your current billing cycle.

Once you cancel your subscription, you will not be eligible for a refund for any unused portion of your current billing cycle.

We may modify this Policy from time to time at our sole discretion. Please check this Policy periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the MEDUSAVR Website, App(s) or Services after any changes to this Policy will constitute your acceptance of those changes.
