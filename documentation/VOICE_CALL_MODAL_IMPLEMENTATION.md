# Voice Call Modal & TTS Improvements - Complete Implementation

## üéØ Summary
Successfully implemented a modern voice call modal system with enhanced TTS cleaning to prevent actions/thoughts from being spoken aloud.

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. TTS Speaking Actions/Thoughts Issue
**Problem**: AI was speaking actions like "*giggles playfully*" out loud
**Solution**: Enhanced TTS text cleaning to remove ALL asterisk content

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `cleanTextForSpeech()` method in `DeepgramVoiceService.ts`
- Changed from selective action removal to complete asterisk content removal: `cleanText.replace(/\*[^*]*\*/g, ' ')`
- Enhanced system prompts with clear examples of what gets spoken vs. what doesn't
- Added comprehensive debug logging for TTS processing

### 2. Voice Call UI/UX Overhaul
**Problem**: Needed modern modal interface with character avatar and better user experience
**Solution**: Created new `VoiceCallModal` component with full-featured interface

**Changes Made**:
- Created `VoiceCallModal.tsx` with modern grey modal and orange outline design
- Added character avatar with pulse animation when speaking
- Implemented 2-second "Calling..." simulation before connection
- Added red phone hang-up button for ending calls
- Integrated recent conversation display within modal

### 3. Removed Top Notifications
**Problem**: Toast notifications appearing at top during voice calls
**Solution**: Removed all toast dependencies and handled feedback within modal

**Changes Made**:
- Removed `useToast` import from `ChatInput.tsx`
- Eliminated all voice call-related toast notifications
- Moved all status feedback into the modal interface
- Status shown directly in modal: "Calling...", "Connected", "Connection failed"

## üìÅ Files Modified

### `/server/services/DeepgramVoiceService.ts`
```typescript
// Enhanced TTS cleaning - removes ALL asterisk content
cleanText.replace(/\*[^*]*\*/g, ' ');

// Updated system prompts
"CRITICAL: Use asterisks ONLY for actions/thoughts that should NOT be spoken aloud"
"Put actual spoken dialogue OUTSIDE of asterisks"
"Example: *giggles playfully* I'm so excited to meet you!"
"The action '*giggles playfully*' will be removed from speech"
"Only 'I'm so excited to meet you!' will be spoken aloud"
```

### `/client/src/components/VoiceCallModal.tsx` (NEW FILE)
```typescript
// Modern modal with:
- Character avatar with pulse animation
- Calling simulation (2 seconds)
- Grey modal with orange outline
- Red hang-up button
- Recent conversation display
- No external toast dependencies
```

### `/client/src/pages/Chat/ChatInput.tsx`
```typescript
// Simplified to single phone button that opens modal
- Removed useVoiceCall hook complexity
- Removed toast notifications
- Added VoiceCallModal integration
- Simplified button from complex voice controls to single phone icon
```

### `/client/src/pages/Chat/ChatPage.tsx`
```typescript
// Added character avatar prop
characterAvatar={character.avatar}
```

## üé® Design Features

### Modal Design
- **Background**: Semi-transparent black overlay
- **Modal**: Grey (`bg-gray-800`) with orange border (`border-orange-500`)
- **Avatar**: Circular with orange border, pulses when character speaks
- **Hang-up Button**: Large red circular button with phone-off icon
- **Status Text**: Color-coded (green for connected, red for errors)

### Animation Features
- **Pulse Animation**: Character avatar pulses during speech using `animate-pulse`
- **Loading Spinner**: Shows during connection process
- **Transition Effects**: Smooth transitions on hover and state changes

## üîß Technical Implementation

### TTS Processing Flow
1. AI generates response with actions in asterisks: "*giggles playfully* I'm so excited!"
2. `cleanTextForSpeech()` removes ALL asterisk content: "I'm so excited!"
3. Only clean dialogue is sent to Deepgram TTS
4. Debug logs show original and cleaned text for monitoring

### Voice Call Flow
1. User clicks green phone button in chat
2. Modal opens with "Calling..." status and spinning loader
3. After 2 seconds, actual voice call starts
4. Character avatar appears and pulses when speaking
5. Recent conversation shows in modal
6. Red hang-up button ends call and closes modal

### State Management
- Modal visibility controlled by `isVoiceModalOpen` state
- Voice call logic handled entirely within modal component
- No external state dependencies or toast notifications

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to any character chat page
3. Click green phone button
4. Verify modal appears with calling animation
5. Confirm character avatar pulses during speech
6. Test that actions in asterisks are NOT spoken
7. Verify hang-up button works properly
8. Check mobile responsiveness

### Expected Behavior
- ‚úÖ Actions like "*giggles*", "*smiles*", "*nods*" are NOT spoken
- ‚úÖ Only dialogue content is converted to speech
- ‚úÖ Modal shows character avatar in center
- ‚úÖ Avatar pulses when character is speaking
- ‚úÖ No toast notifications appear during calls
- ‚úÖ Modern grey/orange design matches app theme
- ‚úÖ Calling simulation works before connection
- ‚úÖ Recent conversation displays in modal

## üöÄ Performance Impact
- **Minimal**: Modal only renders when open
- **Optimized**: TTS cleaning is more efficient with simple regex
- **Clean**: Removed unnecessary toast notification overhead
- **Smooth**: Pulse animations use CSS transforms for optimal performance

## üìù Notes
- Original `VoiceCallComponent.tsx` still exists for test pages but is not used in main chat
- All voice call functionality now centralized in the modal
- TTS debugging can be monitored via server logs
- Modal is fully responsive and works on mobile devices
