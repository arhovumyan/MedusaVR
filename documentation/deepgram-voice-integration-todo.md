# Deepgram Voice Calling Integration - TODO

## Plan Overview
Integrate Deepgram's voice calling functionalities with the "nothingiisreal/mn-celeste-12b" model for real-time voice conversations with AI characters.

## TODO Items

### Backend Integration
- [x] Install Deepgram SDK dependency (`@deepgram/sdk`)
- [x] Create DeepgramVoiceService for handling voice operations
- [x] Create voice routes for REST API endpoints
- [x] Update Socket.IO configuration to handle voice events
- [x] Register voice routes in main app.ts
- [x] Test backend compilation and fix any TypeScript errors
- [x] Build and test with Docker

### Frontend Integration  
- [x] Create useVoiceCall hook for voice functionality
- [x] Create VoiceCallComponent for UI
- [x] Add voice component to ChatPage
- [x] Create VoiceTestPage for testing
- [ ] Test frontend compilation and fix any TypeScript errors
- [ ] Build and test with Docker

### Testing & Security
- [ ] Build project with Docker Compose
- [ ] Check Docker logs for any errors
- [ ] Test voice calling functionality end-to-end
- [ ] Review security implications
- [ ] Document final implementation

## Files Created/Modified

### Backend Files
- âœ… `/server/services/DeepgramVoiceService.ts` - Main voice service
- âœ… `/server/routes/voice.ts` - Voice API endpoints  
- âœ… `/server/config/socket.ts` - Added voice socket events
- âœ… `/server/app.ts` - Registered voice routes

### Frontend Files
- âœ… `/client/src/hooks/useVoiceCall.ts` - Voice calling hook
- âœ… `/client/src/components/VoiceCallComponent.tsx` - Voice UI component
- âœ… `/client/src/pages/Chat/ChatPage.tsx` - Added voice component
- âœ… `/client/src/pages/VoiceTestPage.tsx` - Test page for voice functionality

## Key Features Implemented
- Real-time speech-to-text using Deepgram Nova 2
- AI response generation using nothingiisreal/mn-celeste-12b
- Text-to-speech using Deepgram Aura
- WebSocket integration for real-time communication
- Mute/unmute functionality
- Live transcription display
- Error handling and user feedback

## Environment Variables Required
- DEEPGRAM_API_KEY (already in .env)
- DEEPGRAM_PROJECT_ID (already in .env) 
- OPENROUTER_API_KEY (already in .env)

## Security Considerations
- Authentication required for all voice endpoints
- Session-based voice call management
- Audio data validation
- Rate limiting on voice endpoints
- Proper error handling to prevent information disclosure

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Build with Docker to test compilation
2. âœ… Check logs for any runtime errors  
3. [ ] Test voice functionality end-to-end with UI
4. [ ] Document final implementation

## Build Verification Status âœ…

**Docker Build**: Successful (75.5s total build time)
- âœ… Backend TypeScript compilation successful 
- âœ… Frontend Vite build successful (2377 modules transformed)
- âœ… All containers started successfully
- âœ… Server listening on port 5002
- âœ… Socket.IO server initialized
- âœ… Voice routes properly mounted at `/api/voice`
- âœ… Authentication middleware working correctly
- âœ… Health check endpoint responding

**API Endpoint Tests**:
- âœ… `GET /api/health` - Working
- âœ… `GET /api/voice/status/:characterId` - Working (auth required)

**Key Logs**:
```
âœ… Firebase Admin initialized with project ID
MongoDB connected to test  
âœ… Socket.IO server setup complete
ðŸš€ Server listening on http://0.0.0.0:5002
```
