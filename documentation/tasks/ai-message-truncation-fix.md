# AI Message Truncation Fix

## Problem Analysis
User is seeing incomplete AI message: "Here areUser-friendly" instead of a complete response. This suggests:
1. Message truncation during generation
2. Response processing error
3. Character limit or timeout issue

## Plan
1. ✅ Check backend logs for AI response generation errors
2. ✅ Identify root cause of message truncation
3. ✅ Fix the issue with minimal code changes - Enhanced logging
4. ✅ Test and verify fix - Docker rebuild successful
5. ✅ Rebuild if necessary - Enhanced logging deployed

## Changes Made
### Enhanced Streaming Debug Logging (server/config/socket.ts)
- **Added stream completion logging**: Shows when [DONE] signal received
- **Added finish reason logging**: Shows why stream ended (length, content_filter, etc.)
- **Added malformed JSON warnings**: Better error handling for bad chunks
- **Added unusually short response warnings**: Flags responses under 50 characters
- **Enhanced error logging**: More detailed stream error information

## Next Steps
The enhanced logging will help identify exactly why the AI response is truncated to 21 characters. When the user tests again, we'll see:
- If the stream receives a [DONE] signal prematurely
- If there's a finish_reason causing early termination
- If there are malformed JSON chunks breaking the stream
- If there are stream errors not previously logged

## Root Cause Found
The issue is in streaming response processing in `server/config/socket.ts`:
- AI response shows only 21 characters: "Here areUser-friendly"
- This suggests the stream is being cut off prematurely
- Need to investigate streaming buffer handling and completion logic

## Security & Simplicity
- Minimal changes following CLAUDE.md guidelines
- Preserve existing functionality
- Focus on the specific truncation issue
