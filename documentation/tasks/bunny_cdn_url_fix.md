# Bunny CDN URL Configuration Fix

## Problem Analysis
The avatar images are being uploaded successfully to Bunny CDN storage, but the public URLs are not working because:

1. **Current URL**: `https://www.medusa-vrfriendly.vercel.app/vrfans/characters/test17/avatar/test17_avatar.png`
2. **Issue**: `www.medusa-vrfriendly.vercel.app` is configured as a website domain (serving React app), not a CDN domain
3. **Result**: All requests to file paths return the website's `index.html` instead of the actual files

## Root Cause
The BunnyStorageService is using `www.medusa-vrfriendly.vercel.app` as the public domain for files, but this domain is set up for website hosting, not file serving.

## Tasks to Complete

- [x] 1. Identify the correct CDN domain for Bunny CDN file access
- [x] 2. Update BunnyStorageService to use the proper CDN domain  
- [x] 3. Test file access with the new CDN URL
- [x] 4. Update existing character records if needed
- [x] 5. Verify images display correctly on the website

## ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

### Root Cause Fixed
- **Issue**: `www.medusa-vrfriendly.vercel.app` was configured for website hosting, not file serving
- **Solution**: Updated to use `medusavr.b-cdn.net` (standard Bunny CDN domain)

### Test Results
- ✅ Avatar generation: Working with proper CDN URLs
- ✅ File accessibility: HTTP 200 responses with correct content types
- ✅ Embedding generation: 10 images successfully generated per character

### Current Status
- New characters get correct CDN URLs automatically  
- Embedding system generates 10 diverse images after avatar creation
- Files are properly accessible via `https://medusavr.b-cdn.net/` URLs

## Files to Modify
- `/server/services/BunnyStorageService.ts` - Update publicDomain configuration
