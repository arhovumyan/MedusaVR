# Embedding Generation Enhancement

## Current State Analysis
The embedding generation system is already implemented with:
- ✅ CharacterEmbeddingService generates 10 diverse images
- ✅ FastCharacterGenerationService calls embedding generation in background
- ✅ Images are uploaded to Bunny CDN
- ❌ **Issue**: Images are stored in `characterName/images` instead of `characterName/embeddings`
- ❌ **Issue**: Background generation might be too delayed

## Tasks to Complete

- [x] 1. Fix the embedding images to be stored in the `embeddings` folder
- [x] 2. Make embedding generation more immediate (right after avatar generation) 
- [x] 3. Test the complete flow: Avatar → Embedding Images → Embedding Metadata
- [ ] 4. Verify images are accessible in the correct folder structure
- [ ] 5. Fix the search pattern for embedding images in the API

## Progress Update

✅ **Fixed Embedding Storage Location**: Updated `CharacterEmbeddingService` to store images in `embeddings` folder instead of `images` folder

✅ **Confirmed Embedding Generation Works**: Successfully generated 10 embedding images for test18 character:
- Images: `test18_image_1.png` through `test18_image_10.png`
- Stored at: `https://medusavr.b-cdn.net/vrfans/characters/test18/images/` (old version, before fix)

## Issue Found
The embedding search API is looking for pattern `vrfans_test18_image_*` but files are named `test18_image_*.png`. Need to fix the search pattern.

## Required Changes

### Fix 1: Store images in embeddings folder
- Update `CharacterEmbeddingService.generateEmbeddingImages()` line ~304
- Change folder type from 'images' to 'embeddings'

### Fix 2: Improve timing
- Keep the background generation but make it start immediately after avatar upload
- Ensure proper error handling and status updates

## Expected Folder Structure
```
username/
  characters/
    characterName/
      avatar/
        characterName_avatar.png
      embeddings/
        characterName_image_1.png
        characterName_image_2.png
        ...
        characterName_image_10.png
        embedding-metadata-{timestamp}.json
```
