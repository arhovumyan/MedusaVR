# Security Audit and Vulnerability Fixing - Todo List

## Overview
This document outlines the security vulnerabilities found and the steps to fix them, plus create comprehensive tests to validate the fixes.

## Security Vulnerabilities to Address

### 1. Missing HTTPS / SSL misconfiguration
- [ ] Analyze current SSL/TLS configuration
- [ ] Implement HTTPS redirect in nginx configuration
- [ ] Add Strict-Transport-Security headers
- [ ] Update docker-compose for production SSL
- [ ] Test SSL configuration

### 2. Missing or incorrect HTTP security headers
- [ ] Review current security headers implementation
- [ ] Enhance Content-Security-Policy
- [ ] Add missing security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- [ ] Verify security middleware is properly applied
- [ ] Test security headers implementation

### 3. Directory listing enabled
- [ ] Check nginx configuration for directory indexing
- [ ] Disable auto-indexing in nginx
- [ ] Add proper error pages
- [ ] Test directory access is blocked

### 4. Exposed .git or backup files
- [ ] Review nginx rules for blocking sensitive files
- [ ] Add comprehensive file access blocking
- [ ] Test access to sensitive files is blocked
- [ ] Update .dockerignore and .gitignore

### 5. Default admin credentials
- [ ] Review authentication system
- [ ] Check for hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Implement strong password policies
- [ ] Review JWT secret configuration
- [ ] Test authentication security

### 6. Verbose error messages
- [ ] Review error handling in production
- [ ] Implement proper error sanitization
- [ ] Check debug mode is disabled in production
- [ ] Test error message disclosure

### 7. Unrestricted file uploads (no extension check)
- [ ] Review current file upload validation
- [ ] Enhance MIME type checking
- [ ] Add file signature validation
- [ ] Test file upload security

### 8. Lack of rate limiting / brute force protection
- [ ] Review current rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Enhance rate limiting for different endpoints
- [ ] Add brute force protection for auth endpoints
- [ ] Test rate limiting effectiveness

## Testing Plan
- [ ] Create comprehensive security test suite
- [ ] Test HTTPS/SSL configuration
- [ ] Test security headers
- [ ] Test file access restrictions
- [ ] Test authentication security
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Test file upload security
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Create automated security validation script

## Files to Review/Modify
- [ ] `client/nginx.conf` - Web server configuration
- [ ] `server/middleware/security.ts` - Security middleware
- [ ] `server/app.ts` - Main application configuration
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` - Container configuration
- [ ] Environment configuration files
- [ ] Authentication routes and middleware

## Test Files to Create
- [ ] `/testing/security/https-test.js` - SSL/TLS testing
- [ ] `/testing/security/headers-test.js` - Security headers testing
- [ ] `/testing/security/file-access-test.js` - File access restrictions
- [ ] `/testing/security/auth-security-test.js` - Authentication security
- [ ] `/testing/security/upload-security-test.js` - File upload security
- [ ] `/testing/security/rate-limiting-test.js` - Rate limiting testing
- [ ] `/testing/security/error-handling-test.js` - Error message testing
- [ ] `/testing/security/security-audit-runner.js` - Main test runner

## Documentation to Create
- [ ] Security configuration guide
- [ ] Security testing documentation
- [ ] Production deployment security checklist

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 8 security vulnerabilities are addressed
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite passes
- [ ] Security configuration is documented
- [ ] Production deployment is secure by default
- [ ] No sensitive information is exposed
