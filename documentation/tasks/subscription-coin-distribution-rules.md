# Subscription Coin Distribution Rules Implementation - Todo List

## Overview
Implement sophisticated coin distribution rules for subscription tiers with different billing periods:
- Monthly billing: Coins given monthly while subscription is active, stopped immediately upon cancellation
- Yearly billing: Coins given monthly for full 12-month period, continue even after cancellation until year ends
- Tier-specific coin amounts: Artist (400), Virtuoso (1200), Icon (3000 - updated from 2000)

## Task List

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning
- [x] Analyze current coin service implementation
- [x] Identify required changes for billing period logic
- [x] Update subscription page display with new Icon tier coin amount
- [x] Create detailed implementation plan

### Phase 2: Database Schema Updates
- [x] Add billing period tracking fields to User model
- [x] Add yearly subscription coin tracking fields
- [x] Test database schema changes

### Phase 3: Core Coin Service Updates
- [x] Update MONTHLY_ALLOWANCES with new Icon tier amount (3000)
- [x] Implement billing period specific logic in processMonthlyRefill
- [x] Add yearly subscription coin tracking logic
- [x] Update eligibility checks for different billing periods

### Phase 4: Subscription Logic Updates
- [x] Update subscription upgrade to set proper billing tracking
- [x] Modify subscription creation to initialize new tracking fields
- [x] Update tier coin amounts in all relevant files

### Phase 5: Frontend Updates
- [x] Update subscription page coin amounts to reflect new Icon tier (3000)
- [x] Update subscription management page references
- [x] Update component references and test scripts

### Phase 6: Testing and Validation
- [x] Test monthly billing scenarios
- [x] Test yearly billing scenarios 
- [x] Test subscription cancellation edge cases
- [x] Test tier upgrade/downgrade scenarios
- [x] Build and verify application functionality

### Phase 7: Documentation and Review
- [x] Document implementation changes
- [x] Update reflection.md with lessons learned
- [x] Add comprehensive review section

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

### Changes Summary
1. **Icon Tier Coin Amount**: Updated from 2000 to 3000 coins monthly across all files
2. **Database Schema**: Added `subscriptionStartDate`, `yearlyCoinsRemaining`, `lastCoinGrantDate` fields
3. **Billing Period Logic**: Implemented sophisticated coin distribution rules:
   - Monthly billing: Coins granted on same calendar day each month while active
   - Yearly billing: Coins granted monthly for 12 months regardless of cancellation
4. **Subscription Management**: Updated subscription creation to initialize tracking fields
5. **Frontend Updates**: Updated all UI displays with new coin amounts

### Technical Implementation
- **Core Logic**: Complete rewrite of `CoinService.isEligibleForMonthlyRefill()` method
- **Calendar Day Matching**: Coins granted on exact same day of month as subscription started
- **Yearly Subscription Tracking**: Added counter for remaining monthly grants
- **Cancellation Handling**: Monthly subs stop immediately, yearly subs continue full cycle

### Security & Performance
- ✅ No double-granting with precise date tracking
- ✅ Subscription status validation before any coin grants
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained with existing data

### Files Modified
- `/server/db/models/UserModel.ts` - Database schema
- `/server/services/CoinService.ts` - Core distribution logic
- `/server/routes/subscriptions.ts` - Subscription initialization
- `/client/src/pages/SubscribePage.tsx` - Frontend coin display
- Multiple test and script files updated for consistency

### Testing Results
- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Docker containers running without issues
- ✅ Subscription page displays correctly with new amounts
- ✅ All backend services functioning properly

## Implementation Details

### Database Changes Required:
1. User model additions:
   - `subscriptionStartDate`: Date subscription began (for yearly tracking)
   - `yearlyCoinsRemaining`: Number of monthly coin grants remaining for yearly subs
   - `lastCoinGrantDate`: Exact date of last coin grant (for monthly billing day matching)

### Coin Distribution Logic:
1. **Monthly Billing**: Grant coins on same calendar day each month while `subscription.status === 'active'`
2. **Yearly Billing**: Grant coins monthly for 12 months from start date, regardless of cancellation
3. **Tier Changes**: Apply new tier coin amount from next grant cycle

### Security Considerations:
- Validate subscription status before any coin grants
- Prevent double-granting with precise date tracking
- Audit trail for all coin distributions
- Rate limiting on coin-related endpoints

### Key Files to Modify:
- `/server/db/models/UserModel.ts` - Database schema
- `/server/services/CoinService.ts` - Core distribution logic  
- `/server/routes/subscriptions.ts` - Subscription management
- `/client/src/pages/SubscribePage.tsx` - Display updates
- `/client/src/pages/SubscriptionManagePage.tsx` - Management UI
