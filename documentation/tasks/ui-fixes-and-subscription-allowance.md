# UI Fixes and Subscription Allowance Implementation

## Problem Analysis
1. **White outline issue**: Focus rings appearing on clickable elements (search bar, prompt inputs)
2. **Monthly allowance**: Users should automatically receive subscription-based coin allowances
3. **Chat dropdown arrow**: Remove unnecessary down arrow in chat route
4. **Like button error**: 500 error when trying to like characters in dev mode

## Task List

### ✅ Phase 1: Focus Outline Removal - COMPLETE
- [x] Find and update global CSS to remove focus outlines on form elements
- [x] Test on search bar and prompt inputs to ensure outlines are gone
- [x] Ensure accessibility is maintained with alternative focus indicators

### ✅ Phase 2: Automatic Monthly Allowance - COMPLETE
- [x] Locate subscription tiers and their coin allowances
- [x] Create backend middleware for automatic allowance processing
- [x] Implement monthly allowance logic in CoinService
- [x] Add automatic allowance check middleware to API routes
- [x] Test allowance distribution for different subscription tiers

### ✅ Phase 3: Remove Chat Dropdown Arrow - COMPLETE
- [x] Locate the chat route component with the dropdown arrow
- [x] Remove the arrow element from the UI
- [x] Test to ensure functionality remains intact

### ✅ Phase 4: Fix Like Button Error - COMPLETE
- [x] Check backend like endpoint implementation
- [x] Debug the 500 error in character likes API (fixed require() issue)
- [x] Fix ES modules compatibility in character controller
- [x] Test like functionality in development mode

### ✅ Phase 5: Testing and Verification - COMPLETE
- [x] Rebuild project with Docker
- [x] Test all fixes in development environment
- [x] Verify no new bugs introduced

## Implementation Plan
1. Start with CSS fixes (simplest)
2. Fix like button backend issue
3. Remove chat arrow
4. Implement monthly allowance feature
5. Test everything together

## Security Considerations
- Ensure allowance claims can't be exploited
- Validate user subscriptions before granting allowances
- Implement proper rate limiting on like endpoints
- Maintain authentication for all API calls

## ✅ COMPLETION SUMMARY

All requested fixes have been successfully implemented and tested:

1. **Focus Outline Removal**: Added CSS rules to `/client/src/index.css` to remove white focus outlines while maintaining accessibility with custom focus styles for form elements.

2. **Automatic Monthly Allowance**: Created `/server/middleware/autoAllowance.ts` middleware that automatically processes monthly coin allowances for subscribed users (Artist: 400, Virtuoso: 1200, Icon: 3000 coins) and integrated it into the main API routes.

3. **Chat Dropdown Arrow Removal**: Removed the ChevronDown icon and its container from `/client/src/pages/Chat/CharacterHeader.tsx` to clean up the UI.

4. **Like Button Fix**: Fixed the 500 error in `/server/controllers/character.ts` by replacing the incompatible `require()` statement with proper ES module import syntax.

5. **Testing & Deployment**: Successfully rebuilt and deployed the application using Docker. All containers are running without errors, and the application is ready for production use.

**Build Status**: ✅ All Docker containers built successfully  
**Runtime Status**: ✅ Backend and frontend running without errors  
**Deployment**: ✅ Ready for production use
