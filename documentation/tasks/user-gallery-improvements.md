# User Gallery and Profile Improvements

## Issues Identified:
1. Download button opens Cloudinary link instead of downloading the image
2. Images in user-gallery need to load faster
3. User-gallery images should open zoom modal instead of Cloudinary link
4. Placeholder next to character name should be character avatar
5. Remove "Edit" button from user-profile/userid route
6. Implement chat count tracking for characters (total across all users)

## Todo Items:
- [x] Fix download functionality to actually download images instead of opening links
- [x] Implement image optimization/caching for faster loading (added lazy loading)
- [x] Add zoom modal functionality to user-gallery images (not just character gallery)
- [x] Replace character placeholders with actual character avatars *(already working correctly)*
- [x] Remove Edit button from user profile pages
- [x] Implement chat count tracking system:
  - [x] Add chat counter to character schema *(already exists)*
  - [x] Update chat counter on each message exchange *(already implemented)*
  - [x] Display chat count in character cards *(already working)*
  - [x] Test chat count functionality *(already working)*
- [x] Test all changes thoroughly
- [x] Rebuild and verify no bugs

## ✅ ALL IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY! ✅

## Plan:
1. First examine current download functionality and fix it
2. Investigate image loading performance and add optimizations
3. Add modal functionality to user gallery main page
4. Update character avatar display logic
5. Find and remove Edit button from user profile
