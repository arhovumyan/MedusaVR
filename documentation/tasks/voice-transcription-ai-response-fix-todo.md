# Voice Transcription AI Response Fix - TODO

## Problem Analysis
From the logs analysis, I can see that voice transcription is actually working correctly:

**Working Components:**
- ✅ Voice call authentication and startup
- ✅ Deepgram WebSocket connection (not using HTTP fallback anymore)
- ✅ Audio transcription - correctly transcribed "Hey. Can you hear me?"
- ✅ TTS audio generation working

**Broken Components:**
- ❌ AI Response Generation - OpenRouter API error: 404 Not Found
- ❌ Model "nothingiisreal/mn-celeste-12b" not found/accessible
- ❌ User getting error message instead of proper AI response

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue is NOT with voice transcription (that's working perfectly). The issue is with the AI model API:
1. OpenRouter API returning 404 for model "nothingiisreal/mn-celeste-12b"
2. Model may no longer exist or API endpoint changed
3. Backup error handling shows generic error message to user

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Investigation ✅
- [x] Analyze logs to identify actual problem
- [x] Confirm transcription is working
- [x] Identify AI model API issue

### Phase 2: AI Model Fix ✅
- [x] Check current AI model configuration in voice service
- [x] Verify available models on OpenRouter API  
- [x] Update to working AI model (mistralai/mistral-nemo)
- [x] Test AI response generation
- [x] Ensure proper error handling

### Phase 3: Testing ✅
- [x] Test complete voice call flow
- [x] Verify transcription → AI response → TTS pipeline
- [x] Test multiple voice interactions

## ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED

**Fixed in:** `/Users/aro/Documents/MedusaVR/server/services/DeepgramVoiceService.ts` line 398

**Change:** Updated AI model from `"nothingiisreal/mn-celeste-12b"` to `"mistralai/mistral-nemo"`

**Test Results from Rebuilt System:**
```
📝 Transcript: Finally.
🎯 Voice AI Request using model: mistralai/mistral-nemo
🎯 AI Response: *Smirking* Hey there, vrfans. What's on your mind today?
✅ TTS audio generated successfully
```

**Complete Pipeline Now Working:**
1. ✅ Audio → Deepgram → Transcript: "Finally."
2. ✅ Transcript → OpenRouter → AI Response with working model
3. ✅ AI Response → TTS → Audio output

**Voice calls are now fully functional with proper AI responses!**

### Phase 4: Documentation & Cleanup
- [ ] Update any configuration documentation
- [ ] Add reflection to reflection.md
- [ ] Final testing and validation

## Security Considerations
- Ensure API keys are properly configured
- Validate all AI model responses before TTS
- Maintain secure error handling

## Expected Outcome
- Voice calls work end-to-end with proper AI responses
- User can have complete conversations with AI characters
- Robust error handling for AI service issues
